# ProteomicsUtils

A collection of utility functions for processing, analysing and plotting proteomic data

Please note: These functions alone do not constitute a complete analysis pipeline, and instead are meant for use in conjunction with additional packages (forthcoming in future releases). In addition, these functions require the preprocessing of raw MS datafiles with an identification and quantification program such as [MaxQuant](http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=maxquant:start) or [ProteomeDiscoverer](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/OPTON-30795).
